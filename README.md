## 🧠 About Me

I'm currently pursuing a **PhD in Electronic Technology** at the **University of Seville**, where I focus on the development of advanced microelectronic systems for biomedical applications. My academic journey combines **Biomedical Engineering** with a **Master's in Microelectronics**, allowing me to work on multidisciplinary projects at the intersection of electronics, healthcare, and biological systems.

My work is based across two institutions:

- 🏢 **Institute of Microelectronics of Seville (IMSE-CNM, CSIC/US)**
- 🏫 **School of Computer Engineering (ETSII), University of Seville**

I’m passionate about designing electronic circuits and systems for biomedical sensing, stimulation, and monitoring—particularly using technologies like microelectrode arrays (MEAs) and custom integrated circuits (ASICs) for in-vitro applications.
